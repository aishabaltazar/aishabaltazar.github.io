 			<p>Us earthly beings have developed a system for eliminating wastse, and while you're here it is very important that you follow "waste elimination guidelines."
 			Number 1. Do put all garbage/recycling in the right bin.</p>

 			<p>Number 2. When we eliminate waste from our bodies we go to a bathroom. Liquid waste is a Number 1. and Solid waste is a Number 2. Do flush your Number 1s and 2s. If not this can cause projectile vomiting in humans (excretions of liquid and solid before it turns to waste through the mouth from an upset stomach).</p>
